# RedditMini project

This website was made during my CodeCademy Career Path as a React-Redux Toolkit final exam.

## Frameworks, API

The webpage is built using React v.18. However, the most important in this project is Redux Toolkit state managment pack, which takes care of the whole database and actions in the app. It also uses Reddit Mini's Search API, enabling the user to fetch latest posts regarding their search query.

## Responsiveness

The page is suitable for being launched both on desktop and mobile devices. The website uses CSS Flex in order to dynamically sort cards on the list. I also used @media selectors to make sure the cards are proper size on mobile devices. 

## Visuals

The webpage was designed using CSS stylesheet with a few of in-line styling depending on current state of the app.
